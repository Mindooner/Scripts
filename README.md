## Projects
### System48
![System48](https://i.imgur.com/eLeC0qq.png)

- System48 was first based on a console, with simple features that played audios, set skyboxes, noclip, kill, etc, but then updated and had an actual UI, however with no script executing abilities, with added C Lua commands, and game specific commands like for Fencing and group recruitment plaza.

- 7 Paypal, $7 CC, $10 Steam giftcard.

- 100+ Commands



### Ex-7
![Ex-7](https://i.imgur.com/2dLTRLi.png)

- Ex-7 was the first exploit to figure out bytecode compiling, and used roblox's serializer, then started using proto conversion later on, however AzulX was treated as a script kiddie and later on decided to discontinue Ex-7 due to the continuous hate from vermillion staff and users. 

- $35 USD, paypal only.



### Script-Ware
![Script-Ware](https://i.imgur.com/Au4uYKt.png)

- Despite AzulX retiring from the community, he made a return shortly after, with a release like no other, Script-Ware. Script-Ware only costed $15, while competing with all the other exploits at the time, and continued support up until 2023, eventually discontinuing.

- $15 USD, paypal only.

- Script-Ware was one of the first exploits to have support for multi platforms, supporting MacOS, Windows, and iOS.



### Unified Naming Convention (UNC for short)

- During the development of Script-Ware, AzulX and the Script-Ware developer team decided to work on a project that would attain cross compatibility across executors so scripts wouldn't have to have a variant that worked on, for example, script-ware, another that only worked on synapse x, and a third that worked on free executors. 

- This project was a major breakthrough and is still used to this day.

- Github repo: https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard

- This project was discontinued after 2 years, as the developers have lost interest in ROBLOX, however this still has a huge effect on the community, and can still be used with newer code as of 2024.
