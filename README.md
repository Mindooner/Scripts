# AzulX
AzulX was a user who joined the exploiting community in 2015-2016, AzulX loved to make exploits, collabing with users like QuadCore, Uncle bill, and Customality.
## Projects
### System48
![System48](https://i.imgur.com/eLeC0qq.png)

- System48 was first based on a console, with simple features that played audios, set skyboxes, noclip, kill, etc, but then updated and had an actual UI, however with no script executing abilities, with added C Lua commands, and game specific commands like for Fencing and group recruitment plaza.

- 7 Paypal, $7 CC, $10 Steam giftcard.

- 100+ Commands



### Ex-7
![Ex-7](https://i.imgur.com/2dLTRLi.png)

- Ex-7 was the first exploit to figure out bytecode compiling, and used roblox's serializer, then started using proto conversion later on, however AzulX was treated as a script kiddie and later on decided to discontinue Ex-7 due to the continuous hate from vermillion staff and users. 

- $35 USD, paypal only.



### Script-Ware
![Script-Ware](https://i.imgur.com/Au4uYKt.png)

- Despite AzulX retiring from the community, he made a return shortly after, with a release like no other, Script-Ware. Script-Ware only costed $15, while competing with all the other exploits at the time, and continued support up until 2023, eventually discontinuing.

- $15 USD, paypal only.

- Script-Ware was one of the first exploits to have support for multi platforms, supporting MacOS, Windows, and iOS.



### Unified Naming Convention

- During the development of Script-Ware, AzulX and the Script-Ware developer team decided to work on a project that would attain cross compatibility across executors so scripts wouldn't have to have a variant that worked on, for example, script-ware, another that only worked on synapse x, and a third that worked on free executors. 

- This project was a major breakthrough and is still used to this day.

- Github repo: https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard

- This project was discontinued after 2 years, as the developers have lost interest in ROBLOX, however this still has a huge effect on the community, and can still be used with newer code as of 2024.



# 1337isback
1337isback was a user who joined the exploiting community in 2015-2016, 1337isback was experienced on exploit making however loved to incorporate rats with his exploits, and was known in the community as his exploit "xyz" was a major cookie logger.
## Projects
### Xyz
![Xyz](https://i.imgur.com/3q9c2mb.png) ![QTX](https://i.imgur.com/jnd9wMZ.png)

- 1337isback released trials for xyz that lasted a few days to a week to beam more accounts :D

- Script executor, 61 commands.

- Later became QTX, while still mainting its main features, being malware, trials, script execution but it became a little better.

### RC7
![RC7](https://i.imgur.com/cM0N51v.png)

- $50 Amazon, $25 Paypal pre decompiler, $35 post decompiler.

- RC7 was one of the best external executors to have ever been released, extreme stability, fast updates, support for all functions and scripts, built in topk3k, dex and remotespy.

### RCM
![RCM](https://i.imgur.com/95QUlDb.png)

- A while after RC7 discontinued, CheatBuddy came back with info on planning to revive RC7, however he gave up on attempting to revive RC7 and instead made RCM.

- RCM had trials, originally costing $30 for a lifetime subscription.

- RCM released in august 2018, and discontinued in mid 2020, with almost 2 year support.

# Louka
Louka, also known as FaZe Louka or Rain Louka joined the community in 2016, was a HUGE contribution to the exploiting community, contributing to Synapse X amongst other executors. Louka started off with simple projects, like console software that would save instance, console btools and so on.
## Projects
### Magus Night v2
![MagusNight](https://i.imgur.com/Pzrl3Ii.png)

- Magus Night v2, unlike the other software on this repo was a place stealer.

- Magus Night v2 was completely free of charge.

- It ran on a console, all it did was save the game with scripts into the folder of magus night, with scripts, this was the first of it's kind, an external that only save instanced.

- Magus Night was released in October 2016, and a month later in november, louka stopped working on it and released it's source code.

### verbhaxx
![verbhaxx](https://i.imgur.com/C4gI76Q.png)

- verbhaxx, much like Magus Night v2, ran in a console, only giving you building tools which was also one of it's kind.

- verbhaxx, much as the name suggests, ran on "verbs". Verbs, in simple terms, are C++ functions that could be bound to lua methods, for example, "Exit" was bound to the "Quit Game" button.

### rbx!pwn
![rbxpawn](https://i.imgur.com/siRczd6.png)

- Unlike Louka's other releases, this was a script executor with a full on UI.

![Raindrop](https://i.imgur.com/vP6iolA.png)

- Raindrop Omega, was an april fools joke by Louka, he convinced the community that he'd released [Raindrop](#Raindrop) free of use.

- Raindrop Omega claimed to be level 7, automatically update, be undetected, and have full API support.

### Danghui

![Danghui](https://i.imgur.com/1cs7rC5.png)

- Danghui was a MAJOR contribution, Louka first made it with the actual benefits of Raindrop Omega.

- Level 7 script execution, Undisclosed "execution method"

- Louka then decided to give up on the project, and put it's source code up for bid, and sold it.

- However after it was sold, the source was leaked and exploits continued to skid from the source with only updating the addresses.

- Shortly after he sold Danghui source code, he decided to quit vermillion and leave the exploiting community, due to the bad behaviour of the staff team, and so on.
